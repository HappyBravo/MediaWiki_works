This folder is used by default by the program where it will search for the PDFs which will be processed and uploaded in the server.
---

It is recommended to remove the PDFs and the processed PDFs from [./new](PDFs/new) folder after those are uploaded.


----

If using [```watcher.py```](../watcher.py) 
---
Then it is not necessary to remove files, just add new files after running the program. Those new files will be selected, processed and uploaded automatically.
